NAME
====

META::verauthapi - apply :ver:auth:api from META on classes

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
# in distribution "Frobnicate"
class Frobnicate { }

use META::verauthapi $?DISTRIBUTION, Frobnicate;

say Frobnicate.^ver;   # v1.2.3
say Frobnicate.^auth;  # zef:lizmat
say Frobnicate.^api;   # 0
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

META::varauthapi provides an easy way to keep the meta information of one of more classes in a distribution in sync with the information in the META6.json file of that distribution.

The `use` statement needs to be specified with the `$?DISTRIBUTION` variable, and will by default set the `:ver`, `:auth` and `:api` of the all the classes listed in the `"provides"` field in the META information.

For more control, it is also possible to list the classes to set as additional arguments in the `use` statement.
